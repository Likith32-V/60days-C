# 60days-C-Mastery ðŸš€

Welcome to my 60-day journey to mastering the C programming language in a practical, real-world way.  
This repository will track my daily progress as I dive deep into memory, pointers, data structures, and system-level programming in C.

## Goals

- Develop a solid understanding of core and advanced C concepts
- Write clean, modular, efficient C code
- Understand memory management deeply
- Build and document **3 minor** and **3 major** real-world C projects
- Follow best industry practices (e.g., Makefile usage, `gdb`, header files, modular code)
